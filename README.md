# Number Guessing Game

This is my 3rd project using Html/Css/JavaScript.
I create a Number guessing game as stated in the title that tells the user to input a number 1 - 100. 

["Game Screen"](Game.png)

If the user  guess too high or too low the text changes 

["Too High"](TooHigh.png) ["TooLow](TooLow.png) 

If the user guesses right the words change to congratulate the user.

The submit button is disabled but if the user chooses to play again they can press the restart button.
Or if they whish to stop the game disappears.
